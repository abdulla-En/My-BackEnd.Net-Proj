How Microsoft Copilot Helped
While building this User Management API, I used Microsoft Copilot to support me through the development process. It wasn’t just about writing code faster — Copilot helped me think through problems, learn new techniques, and stay focused on what mattered most.
What Copilot Did
• 	It explained backend concepts like DTOs, mapping, and password hashing in a way that made sense and was easy to apply.
• 	It helped me structure my endpoints clearly and follow good RESTful design.
• 	It guided me through setting up middleware for authentication, error handling, and logging — things I might have missed otherwise.
• 	It suggested improvements like tracking timestamps, preventing password reuse, and checking for duplicate emails.
• 	It generated a full  file so I could test all my endpoints quickly and consistently.
What I Did
Copilot didn’t take over the project — it gave me the tools and suggestions, but left the important decisions to me. I wrote the core logic, made the design choices, and learned a lot along the way. It felt more like working with a helpful teammate than using an automation tool.
This project is stronger because of that collaboration. The code is cleaner, the API is more secure, and I had more time to focus on building features instead of getting stuck on repetitive tasks.
